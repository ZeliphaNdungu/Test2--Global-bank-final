-	Revenue growth. Theres need to improve the revenue growth to at least 5% ; above the normal inflation rates
-	Loans issued should be stabilized as they have a direct relationship with the revenue performance.
-	The revenue totals across the 3 data sets needs to be aligned with the total revenue.
-	Decline in accounts opened needs to also be addressed with the retail banking team and this explains the declining margins.
-	A deep dive into the reasons for the declining new accounts statistics needs to be done.
-	Europe’s growth has stagnated. Reasons for this lack of growth need to be provided
-	The average CAGR is low  at 1%. An understanding of why it is low, how it compares  to the industry etc . measures to improve etc need to be explored.
2.	Expenses – The bank needs to be aggressive in cost reduction. The worsening economic scenarios demand an internal check on business cost efficiencies.
3.	Margins
-	The declining retail banking margins need to be explained and improved.
-	Although investment banking has the highest margins in 2021, the declining trend needs to looked into.
-	Europe’s declining margins need to be addressed with cost reduction & margin improvement initiatives.
4.	Customer satisfaction needs to be addressed to avoid any further reductions that will also end up affecting the business performance. The customer service department needs to look into this.
